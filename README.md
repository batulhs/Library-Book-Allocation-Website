# ðŸ“– Library Book Allocation System

A full-stack web app that allocates library books across branches based on **demand** and **capacity**.  
It uses Flask for the backend with two allocation strategies (**Brute Force & Balanced**) and a modern interactive frontend for easy visualization.

- Beautiful animated loader and modern responsive design.
- Displays allocation plans in a clean, visual format.
### Backend (Flask, Python)
- REST API for handling allocation requests.
- Implements two allocation algorithms (Brute Force & Balanced).
- Supports JSON input/output for easy integration.
### Styling

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- User Authentication â€“ Add login and roles (e.g., admin, librarian, branch manager) for secure access.
- Database Integration â€“ Store book demand, branch capacities, and allocations in a database (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- Persistent Data â€“ Keep demand/capacity records across sessions instead of resetting on refresh.
- Advanced Allocation Algorithms â€“ Implement optimized strategies like:
   - Greedy + fairness constraints
   - Linear programming (e.g., with PuLP)
   - Machine learningâ€“based predictions
- Export Options â€“ Allow users to download allocation results as PDF, CSV, or Excel.
- Interactive Visualizations â€“ Show charts/graphs for demand vs. capacity, allocation distribution, etc.
- Error Handling & Validation â€“ More user-friendly messages for invalid inputs or missing data.
- Mobile-Friendly UI â€“ Improve responsiveness for better experience on tablets/phones.
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle â€“ Let users switch between themes.
- Demo Data Button â€“ Pre-fill with example demand/capacity to quickly try the tool.
- Deployment â€“ Host the app on a public server (Heroku, Render, or GitHub Pages + API backend).

## Run Locally
1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors
   python server.py
